This is my school project for NOIT '09.
This project it's not something awesome, using cut-edge technologies or something,
but I'm still proud of it, since I've wrote this more than two years ago, for less than a week,
without using any framework, but implementing my own MVC structure.

Since StudentX is no longer online, I decided to put it's source here. Krasimir Stoev was involved in development of this, too(mostly criticism and muttering, but still invloved :)
And by the way, sorry for those many comments in the source, but that was a requirement from the jury.

This project is licensed under GNU General Public License v2 and it's using the open source template Lazydays(I've never been good in web design)
and the asido library for manipulating images.

Have fun.
